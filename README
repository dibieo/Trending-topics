Running the project

Install Django. We're using the latest version django 1.4 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/install/#installing-official-release

Change the template_DIR  location in ~/app/TopicalTrends/trends/trends/settings.py to match the absolute path to the template directory on your machine. Right now, it is     '/home/ovo/Documents/Treding-topics/app/TopicalTrends/trends/ui/templates' on my machine.

Start django development webserver by going to ~/app/TopicalTrends/trends/ and running python manage.py runserver

The server should startup with no errors usually on port 8000 of localhost

Launch the app on in a web browser by going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ui

You should see a search form

Results to search input would be returned like when you run the main.py method.

soheil's old notes on running the code:
running the code is simple:
from the python interactive console
1- import insertFeeds  
//explanation: this will read the feeds in the feed_links and put them in the source table (just the link for now, no additional data, for now) unless you want to change the feeds being read you only have to run this once

2- import insertFeedItems
//explanation: this will read items from the feeds in source and will tag them storing the results in the feed_item, tags and feeditem_tags tables
