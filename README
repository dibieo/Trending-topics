Running the project

Install Django. We're using the latest version django 1.4 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/install/#installing-official-release

Change the template_DIR  location in ~/app/TopicalTrends/trends/trends/settings.py to match the absolute path to the template directory on your machine. Right now, it is     '/home/ovo/Documents/Treding-topics/app/TopicalTrends/trends/ui/templates' on my machine.

Start django development webserver by going to ~/app/TopicalTrends/trends/ and running python manage.py runserver

The server should startup with no errors usually on port 8000 of localhost

Launch the app on in a web browser by going to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ui

You should see a search form

Results to search input would be returned like when you run the main.py method.
